"""Grounded local-LLM reranker for the public direct-value questions.

The first 361 questions ask for values that are present in one issuer/year
report, but lexical top-k retrieval is not reliable enough: the requested row
can be a short child row (for example, "Bang VND"), while its meaning lives in a section
row or a column header.  This solver therefore enumerates *every numeric cell*
in the entity/year/scope-constrained reports, deterministically ranks complete
row/section/header/table evidence, and lets the local Qwen3-8B checkpoint make
the final semantic selection from a high-recall shortlist.

The model never supplies an answer literal.  It may only select grounded cell
IDs and a small whitelisted operation; Python builds and executes the pandas
expression deterministically.  Per-question JSON logs are written atomically
after every attempt and are reusable after interruption.

Rules:
- Match the complete accounting concept, named subsidiary/segment/currency, report scope, and requested date/year.
- Read `section`, `column_header`, and `table_context`; a short row label inherits its meaning from them.
- Distinguish close concepts (for example lessor `cam ket cho thue` versus lessee `cam ket thue`).
- `So cuoi nam`, `31/12/YYYY`, `nam nay`, and the explicit target year beat prior/opening-period columns.
- If the report has an explicit TOTAL/TONG CONG cell, select that one with operation `value`; do not sum its components.
- Use `sum` only when the question truly requires adding multiple selected cells and no explicit total exists.
- Use `difference` only for explicit first-minus-second wording; otherwise use `abs_difference` for a requested difference.
- Most questions use exactly one selected cell and operation `value`.
- Never select row ordinals, line-item codes, years, note numbers, dates, or percentages unrelated to the requested metric.
- Never invent a candidate ID or answer value. `selected_ids` must contain every value used and no irrelevant value.
